Bootstrap vs. permutation tests
===============================

According to this `post <http://pillowlab.princeton.edu/teaching/mathtools16/slides/lec21_Bootstrap.pdf>`__:

    Bootstrapping generally refers to statistical approach to quantifying uncertainty by re-using the data, specifically random resampling with replacement. Permutation-based analyses resemble the bootstrap in that they rely on randomizations of the observed data. The primary difference is that while bootstrap analyses typically seek to quantify the sampling distribution of some statistic computed from the data, permutation analyses typically seek to quantify the null distribution. That is, they seek to break whatever structure might be preset in a dataset, and quantify the kinds of patterns one expects to see “purely by chance.”
