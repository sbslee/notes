Developed specifically for science, engineering, and financial computations, Intelâ„¢ Math Kernel Library (MKL) is a set of threaded and vectorized math routines that work to accelerate various math functions and applications. Anaconda has packaged MKL-powered binary versions of some of the most popular numerical/scientific Python libraries into MKL Optimizations for improved performance.
