## Install on Linux <a name="Install-on-Linux"></a>

On the server, download the install bash script. You can see the full list of versions at the [Anaconda repo](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/).

```
$ curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.11-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Next, check the integrity of the downloaded file.

```
$ md5sum Anaconda3-2020.11-Linux-x86_64.sh
4cd48ef23a075e8555a8b6d0a8c4bae2  Anaconda3-2020.11-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

After confirming the file is intact, run the bash script.

```
$ bash Anaconda3-2020.11-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Once installation is complete, youâ€™ll receive the following output:

```
...
installation finished.
Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3

## Package management for R <a name="Package-management-for-R"></a>

R package management via Anaconda can be tricky sometimes. I learned in the hard way that setting the `.condarc` file saves many troubles.

```
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```
